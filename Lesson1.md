## **Topics of the course** 
* Population 
* Sample 
* Design Studies 
* Scope
* EXploratory data analysis 
* Inferences

# **Data basics**  

## **Types of variables**      
 
### *Numerical*  

* Continuous: infinite number of values within a range
* Discrete: one specific set of numeric values

### *Categorical*  

* Ordinal: variable have inherent ordering
* Regular categorical: dont have order


## **Relationships between variables**   

two variables tha show some connection with one another are called associated 
(dependent)

if the variables are not associated then are independent

## **Observational studies and experiments**       
   
### *Observational*        
  
Collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise
  
With them you can only asses association -- causal inference methods (for the most part!)
   
### *Experiment*      

*Randomly assign* subject to treatments -- variation of the variable depends on the researcher

establish causal connection 

deals with the problem of **confounding variables**

**confounding variables:** Extraneous variables that affect both the explanatory and the response variable, and taht amke it seem like there is a realionship between them 


## **Sampling and sources of bias**       

Census is an impossibility

With a sample we can:

do an *Exploratory analysis*: Examine a part of the population to get an idea of the population as a whole

and as *inference study*: Generalized the idea to the population           
**To be validad** ----> sample needs to be representative 

### **Problem with samples: Sample bias**

* Convenience sample: individuals  who are easily accesible

* Non-response: if only a (non-random) fraction of the randomly sampled people respond to a survey susch that the sample is no loger representative of the population

* Voluntary response: Occurs when the sample consists of people who volunteer to respond
